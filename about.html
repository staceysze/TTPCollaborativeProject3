        Created by David Yu and Stacey So.</br>
        This is one of the collaborative projects for a pre-internship program (Summer 2016).
        The goal of this project is to collaborate with a partner and get familiar with the github
        work flow. Our goal is to successfully use spotify api to send a request, get a reponse and
        manipulate the JSON object. The end product is displayed on the web page by using html and
        css. This project includes : 1) - a fixed vertical navigation bar on both pages (home and about),
        2) - parallax (When you scroll the webpage, you can observe it with the social media icons),
        3) - slider (For every search that you made, the slider will show the album covers of that artist),
        4) - modal effects (When the user click on each photo in the gallery, a box will pop up with
        information of that particular album).</br></br>
