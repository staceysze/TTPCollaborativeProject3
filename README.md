# TTPCollaborativeProject3

Created by David Yu and Stacey So.

This is one of the collaborative projects for a pre-internship program (Summer 2016).
The goal of this project is to collaborate with a partner and get familiar with the github work flow. 
Our goal is to successfully use spotify api to send a request, get a reponse and manipulate the JSON object. 
The end product is displayed on the web page by using html and css.
This project includes :
      1) - a fixed vertical navigation bar on both pages (home and about), 
      2) - parallax (When you scroll the webpage, you can observe it with the social media icons), 
      3) - slider (For every search that you made, the slider will show the album covers of that artist), 
      4) - modal effects (When the user click on each photo in the gallery, a box will pop up with information of that particular album).
